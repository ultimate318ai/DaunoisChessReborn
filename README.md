I try to learn angular ts, what a perfect opportunity to build a website !

## Website Content

This website will contain following sections:
 - Home page (Still useful!)
 - Chess part (Yes I like it)
 - CV part (a lot of things about me)

## Technologies used

For instance, I will use Angular TS with css and basic html.
